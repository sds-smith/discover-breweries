# Discover Breweries 3.0

A brewery locator app originally built for the [RSM HCD Coding Challenge](<https://rsm-hcd-coding-challenge.s3.amazonaws.com/requirements/RSM+HCD+Coding+Challenge+Instructions+(1).pdf>) and powered by the [OpenBreweryDB API](https://www.openbrewerydb.org/documentation).

Since its original development as a full-stack MERN app in December, 2022, this app has seen multiple iterations, as it has become a personal playground where I can try out new things as I continue to explore and learn new technologies and skills.

For this iteration, I removed the node/express server and moved the backend logic into AWS Lambda function for a more lightweight serverless deployment.

The frontend React app is served from a static build in an AWS S3 bucket.

- API calls to OpenBreweryDB are now made directly from the frontend

Three Lambda functions power the backend, connecting to MongoDB Atlas and performing the full range of CRUD operations:

- `discover-breweries_rotateCities`
  - Triggered by a custom Cloudwatch Event which fires every 24 hours at midnight
  - Selects a new random city to feature and updates the list of featured breweries accordingly
- `discover-breweries_getFeaturedBreweries`
  - Triggered by an API Gateway when a request is sent to the custom endpoint from the app
  - Queries the featured city's breweries from MongoDB and returns the list to the app
- `discover-breweries_getSearchCityBreweries`
  - Here, API Gateway receives a query string in the request from the app and passes that payload through to the Lambda function
  - The Lambda function processes the payload and includes it in the Mongo query, returning the response to the frontend

## Primary Tech Stack

- MongoDB 6.0
- React.js 18.2.8
- AWS Cloudfront
- AWS S3 Buckets
- AWS Lambda
- AWS API Gateway
- AWS Cloudwatch Events

### Additional Technologies used:

- React Router for client-side routing
- TypeScript for all client-side code
- Axios for http requests
- Google-map-react for Google Maps integration
- Material UI Component Library
- CSS-in-JS (emotion) for styling
- Mongoose for MongoDB integration
